# Mesh Healthbar - sample project

*(this sample project uses features introduced in defold version 1.7.0 and will not work in previous versions.)*

 	Example of mesh component being used as a healthbar and manipulated through runtime mechanics.
 	The mesh data includes vertex color data that updates as the bar increases or decreases in value
 	as well as vertices moving in position. Healthbar is non-gui so it can be used in the go world.

*( Mesh guide showing buffer data visual representations with healthbar )*

- Improvement could be to add instancing to mesh/material if being used as several healthbars on screen.
